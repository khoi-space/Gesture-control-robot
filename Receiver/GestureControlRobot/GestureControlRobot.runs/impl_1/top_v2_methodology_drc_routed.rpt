DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP motor_ctrl_inst/threshold_a0 input pin motor_ctrl_inst/threshold_a0/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
Related violations: <none>

DPIR-1#2 Warning
